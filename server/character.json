{"name":"Ayriana","age":"Adult","kin":{"name":"Halfling","description":"Halflings are short humanoids often found in hilly farmlands where they live in earthen dwellings with wellstocked larders. They are modest and amiable by nature, with a natural affinity for hearth and home. Halflings are neither warlike nor ambitious, but highly drawn to epic tales and beautiful songs from days long gone. From time to time, this desire can lead them to leave the safety of their homes in search of grand adventures. Because of their vulnerability and fear of “the tall ones,” they are good at staying hidden and quickly getting out of critical situations.","baseMovement":8},"profession":"Fighter","currentHp":12,"currentWp":10,"weakness":{"name":"Fearful of Magic","description":"Magic is an evil force and mages cannot be trusted."},"strength":{"title":"Strength","abbreviation":"STR","score":11},"constitution":{"title":"Constitution","abbreviation":"CON","score":12},"agillity":{"title":"Agillity","abbreviation":"AGL","score":17},"intelligence":{"title":"Intelligence","abbreviation":"INT","score":15},"willpower":{"title":"Willpower","abbreviation":"WIL","score":12},"charisma":{"title":"Charisma","abbreviation":"CHA","score":10},"exhausted":false,"sickly":false,"dazed":true,"angry":false,"scared":false,"disheartened":false,"axes":{"name":"Axes","description":"Your ability to fight with the weapon type Axes.","relatedAttribute":"STR","trained":false,"advancement":false},"bows":{"name":"Bows","description":"Your ability to fight with the weapon type Bows.","relatedAttribute":"AGL","trained":false,"advancement":false},"brawling":{"name":"Brawling","description":"Your ability to fight with the weapon type Brawling.","relatedAttribute":"STR","trained":false,"advancement":false},"crossbows":{"name":"Crossbows","description":"Your ability to fight with the weapon type Crossbows.","relatedAttribute":"AGL","trained":false,"advancement":false},"hammers":{"name":"Hammers","description":"Your ability to fight with the weapon type Hammers.","relatedAttribute":"STR","trained":false,"advancement":false},"knives":{"name":"Knives","description":"Your ability to fight with the weapon type Knives.","relatedAttribute":"AGL","trained":false,"advancement":false},"slings":{"name":"Slings","description":"Your ability to fight with the weapon type Slings.","relatedAttribute":"AGL","trained":false,"advancement":false},"spears":{"name":"Spears","description":"Your ability to fight with the weapon type Spears.","relatedAttribute":"STR","trained":false,"advancement":false},"staves":{"name":"Staves","description":"Your ability to fight with the weapon type Staves.","relatedAttribute":"AGL","trained":false,"advancement":false},"swords":{"name":"Swords","description":"Your ability to fight with the weapon type Swords.","relatedAttribute":"STR","trained":false,"advancement":false},"acrobatics":{"name":"Acrobatics","description":"When jumping, climbing, balancing or performing a similar physical action, roll for this skill.","relatedAttribute":"STR","trained":false,"advancement":false},"awareness":{"name":"Awareness","description":"As an adventurer you must always be on your guard, or you won’t live long.
